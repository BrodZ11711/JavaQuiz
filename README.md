JavaQuiz Time!

What are we to achieve?
We are to create a program that gives the user a series of questions, with multiple choice answers. You're timed also, and at the end of the program, your total answers, plus time remaining, would tally your score, and you could add it to a leaderboard. 

Is this what you achieved?
Unfortunetely.... no. I got the questions and multiple choice answers to work, however, i couldn't figure out how to make the timer stop when the questions were over. I also didnt include a leaderboard functionality. 

If you weren't able to achieve this, why werent you? And what would you do differently?
I wasn't able to achieve this due to the preasure and time of how far back i am. After a few problems financilly, i was locked out and unable to use Monash resources. However I'm trying to power through what I can and catch back up to class, so I did have to leave some stuff out.
